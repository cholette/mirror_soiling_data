# Mirror Soiling Data
A data repository for soiling of solar mirrors.
Each folder contains experimental data collected at the named location including the time period and a parameters file that is used to set constants possibly dependent on site location.
The data are organized in Excel sheets: 
"Dust" contains constant related to local dust characteristics (if available, otherwise taken from literature);
"Source_Intensity" has optics data related to the device used to measure the reflectance (D&S reflectometer in most cases)
"Tilts" reports the tilt history for each mirror exposed outdoor for the experiments
"Reflectance_Average" reports the measured values of reflectance on the mirrors
"Reflectance_Sigma" reports the computed variance of the reflectance measurements on each mirrors (usually 6 to 9 data points are collected on each mirror)
